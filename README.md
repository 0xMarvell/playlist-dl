# PlaylistDL ðŸ“¹

PlaylistDL is really just a basic python script for downloading youtube playlists all at once. It solves the problem of wasting an unnecessary amount of time on downloading videos one by one.
It makes use of the [pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/index.html) library.

## How to use PlaylistDL

- If not already installed, download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Clone github repo
    ```bash

    ```
